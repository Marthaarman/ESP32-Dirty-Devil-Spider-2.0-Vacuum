# Dirty Devil Spider 2.0 robot vacuum takeover with ESP32

The main chip on the Dirty Devil Spider 2.0 (DDS2) is removed in this project and replaced with an ESP32c3 super mini
This repo contains control files for the DDS2 and an hardware abstraction layer (HAL) to interface with an ESP32c3 super mini.

For now, the project is only focussing on replacing the basic function as was. 
In the future integration with home-assistant will be coded.
